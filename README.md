# reflectance_field_map
Reference implementation of the Reflectance Field Map (Foster, Johnson, Kuipers ICRA 2023)

This repository will contain a standalone C++ implementation of the ReflectanceFieldMap, including ROS integration, by the end of January 2024. The current ReflectanceFieldMap, as described in the ICRA '23 paper, lives in our larger Vulcan repository here: https://github.com/collinej/Vulcan/tree/master/src/hssh/metrical/mapping. 

The Python directory contains the standalone Python implementation used to generate the results for the ICRA '23 paper.
